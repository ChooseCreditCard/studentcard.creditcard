    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Student or First Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>
        A student or first credit card is designed for people with little or no prior credit history.
        Limits are usually modest, fees are often simplified, and some cards include guardrails such
        as spending alerts or stricter approval rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main goal is not luxury perks, but <strong>establishing a track record</strong>: paying on time,
        managing a small limit and learning how billing cycles and interest work. Used correctly,
        these cards can be a stepping stone toward stronger credit profiles later.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Limits & Fees -->
    <section id="limits" class="section">
      <h2>Limits, Fees and Guardrails on Student Cards</h2>
      <p>
        Because student cards target beginners, they usually come with tighter constraints than
        mainstream cards. Typical characteristics include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lower credit limits</strong> to reduce risk of overspending.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple pricing structures</strong> with fewer complex features.</li>
        <li><strong>Higher standard APR</strong> than prime cards, especially after promos.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional reminders</strong> for upcoming due dates or high utilization.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Before applying, check:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Annual fee and whether it’s waived for the first year.</li>
        <li>Any penalty APR for missed payments.</li>
        <li>Foreign transaction fees if you plan to study or travel abroad.</li>
        <li>Late payment fees and how quickly they are applied.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Building Credit -->
    <section id="building" class="section">
      <h2>Using a Student Card to Build Credit Safely</h2>
      <p>
        The biggest value of a student card is the chance to build a positive credit history from day one.
        Key habits that typically matter most for scoring models include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Paying on time:</strong> even one late payment can damage your record.</li>
        <li><strong>Keeping utilization low:</strong> many guidelines suggest staying well below 30% of your limit.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoiding frequent applications:</strong> too many credit checks in a short period can be a warning signal.</li>
        <li><strong>Letting positive history age:</strong> long-term, consistent use is more important than quick churn.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Over time, responsible use of a student card can make it easier to qualify for
        cards with stronger rewards, higher limits or additional benefits.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Risks -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Common Risks and Mistakes with First Cards</h2>
      <p>
        Because student cards are often a first encounter with revolving credit, certain risks appear again and again:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Carrying high-interest balances:</strong> using the card as long-term borrowing instead of
          paying in full can become expensive very quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Maxing out the limit:</strong> high utilization can hurt credit scores and increase stress
          if an unexpected bill arrives.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Missing the first payments:</strong> early late payments can lock you into higher APRs and
          make upgrades harder later.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A simple rule of thumb: treat the card as a <strong>payment tool</strong>, not a source of extra money.
        Charging occasional, planned purchases and paying them off in full builds a much stronger profile
        than carrying a balance.
