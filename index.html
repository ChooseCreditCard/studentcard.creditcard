    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Student or Starter Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>Student or starter credit cards are designed for people with little or no credit history — typically students or recent adults. They often come with lower credit limits, lower fees, or simpler approval criteria compared to premium cards.</p>
      <p>These cards aim to help you build a positive payment history, establish credit, and learn responsible card use without the risks or commitments tied to high-limit or benefits-heavy cards.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Eligibility / Who It’s For -->
    <section id="eligibility" class="section">
      <h2>Who Benefits from Student Cards & Why They Exist</h2>
      <p>People with no prior credit history, international students, recent graduates, or those rebuilding credit often qualify. Because the risk to issuers is lower (small credit lines, modest use), companies are willing to approve applications they would usually decline for premium cards.</p>
      <p>Student cards are often the first step to building credit — they give you the chance to demonstrate responsible behavior via on-time payments and manageable utilization, which helps when you upgrade or apply for larger credit products later.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Best Practices -->
    <section id="best-practices" class="section">
      <h2>How to Use a Student Credit Card Wisely</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Use it for small, regular expenses you can pay off immediately (subscriptions, groceries, small bills).</li>
        <li>Always pay the full balance on time each month — avoid carrying debt or revolving balances.</li>
        <li>Keep utilization low (ideally under 30%) — this helps credit scoring and shows responsible use.</li>
        <li>Avoid applying for multiple cards at once — focus on building a steady history with one card first.</li>
        <li>Check fees, foreign transaction charges and reward structures before using abroad or online — benefits are often minimal on student cards.</li>
      </ul>
